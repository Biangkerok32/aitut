Hello everyone,

We have received a number of inquiries about Google Summer of Code 2020 (GSoC '20). While Google hasn’t yet opened org applications, nor are we guaranteed to be accepted, we wanted to provide some high level overview of things potential student participants should know before starting a GSoC project.

To get started, we recommend that you review the following documents and get your environment set up correctly.

    GitHub Readme: https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources 25
    Contributing to the MIT App Inventor Sources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJlh5-U-eLAxXTvK2QxIrJklC3EjZgsavbIFe4FhxyA/edit#heading=h.57b2hufh8hwc 23
    How to build App Inventor from the MIT sources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xc9yt02x3BRoq5m1PJHBr81OOv69rEBy8LVG_84j9jc/edit 17
    How to add a property: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ukpZXcd0fIn1fV0cNp4J00wrfwwA1daswU1yY6dqqfs/edit 17
    How to add a component: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xk9dMfczvjbbwD-wMsr-ffqkTlE3ga0ocCE1KOb2wvw/edit 7
    Look at the set of possible projects from 2019: https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/wiki/Projects-GSoC-2019 13
    Look at the “help wanted” issues: https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted" 18

Before submitting a GSoC proposal, you will need to be able to successfully build your own copy of App Inventor and build a sufficiently complex app to show your grasp of how App Inventor works. Furthermore, knowledge of Java and JavaScript are essential to a successful GSoC project. Applicants who demonstrate good technical ability and make contributions to App Inventor prior to the GSoC review period tend to rank more highly when we review proposals as they often demonstrate a deeper understanding of how App Inventor works and its design principals. The App Inventor team is available to also help answer any inquiries if you ask your questions in this category.

We may periodically update this post with more information.

Update 2020-02-20:

Google has announced the GSOC 2020 organizations. MIT App Inventor will be participating as an organization this year. See the full list of organizations here 3. The student application period will be from March 16-31, so anyone interested in applying please make sure you submit everything. Note that in addition to the GSOC application, there is a separate form 11 you must fill out that are App Inventor specific preliminaries.

Please do not reply to this topic with questions. Instead, start a new topic with your specific question.

Regards,
Evan W. Patton, Ph.D.
Lead Software Engineer, MIT App Inventor
